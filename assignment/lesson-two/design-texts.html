            <h1>Repetition</h1>
            <img src="image/goddness.jpg">
            <p> On your web page, you can create a visually appealing rhythm by repeating certain design elements. 
                For example, try alternating the same two text fonts and the same three colors in different sections 
                of your page. This helps visitors to uniquely remember your website, 
                causing them to think of you the next time they look for an expert in your field.</p>

            <h1>Hierarchy</h1>
            <img src="image/hierarchy.gif">

            <p>hierarchy plays an important role in art and design compositions.
                 Compositions of excellent quality divide the elements into three levels of hierarchy: 
                 the most important, the middle, and the least important. The reason is that the human brain 
                 cannot give the same level of importance to every element of a story, show or composition. On the contrary,
                  he tends to give more importance to the first elements that he perceives, and this is where the great artists
                   want to focus the attention of the spectators. Choosing the location of each element according to its 
                   level of importance is the key to 
                mastering this principle and your beautiful composition..</p>

            <h1>Harmony</h1>
            <img src="image/ice-cream.gif">

            <p>This principle tries to find the correct balance with the correct elements. 
                To achieve this sense of harmony, the designer must ensure that each element 
                has a specific place and role in the composition. Nothing should be out of place, 
                useless, or random. Harmony is achieved when the different elements and principles
                 present on the page work “in agreement”, which makes this principle worthy of being 
                 “the finishing touch”..</p>
